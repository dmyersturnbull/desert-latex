\paragraph*{I am a paragraph}  % * to suppress numbering
\indx{keyword} is shorthand for keyword\index{keyword}.
\Indx{Quantum xenochromodynamics} is characterized by a module defined $M[F]$ over a finite field $F$ alongside a set $D$ of \ac{D1} ligands \cite{yolov6}.
This is \qtyproduct{61 x 61 x 114}{\centi\meter}.
Add a \code{*} when \emph{introducing} terms, for emphasis: \indx*{starred}.
The style is set with \code{style / indx-starred} option. \footnote{This is a great idea.} See? \ac{CRISPR}. \ac{CRISPR}.
Using \ctan{chemformula}, \ch{KCr(SO4)2 * 12 H2O}. \ch{CH+CH}.

Also see \ctan{chemmacros} and \ctan{chemfig}.
\chemfig{*5(-=--=)}


(This too: \indx{space aliens}[aliens!space]).
It is usually computed in the cloud. With \ac{CRISPR}.

Using \ctan{circuitikz}:

\begin{circuitikz}
\draw (0,0) to[R=2<\ohm>, i=?, v=84<\volt>] (2,0) --
(2,2) to[V<=84<\volt>] (0,2)
-- (0,0);
\end{circuitikz}


\textsc{This had better be in smallcaps.}

Quotations can use \ctan{csquotes}, or key--value commands that Desert added:
As Johnson herself once said, \Quote[cite={johnson2022}, punct=.]{life is good}
She also said that in Spanish, \Quote[style=display, lang=spanish]{la vida es buena}.
Finally, we have the \code{Quotation} environment, which defaults to \code{style=display}.


See? Is this ok?


We recovered \qty{5}{\tera\joule} from the craft.

    See? This continued to a second paragraph, and it needs a little more space between items for that reason. Otherwise it's not clear where a paragraph ends and where a bullet point ends.

\begin{Theorem}[label=mythm, name=Fiveness]
5 = 5
\end{Theorem}

\begin{proof}
x = x \forall x\\
\therefore 5 = 5
\end{proof}

\begin{Hint}[name = An optional title., label=fives]
Some ``hint". \ac{D1}
Refer to \cref{mythm}.
